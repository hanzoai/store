   ```

2. **Configure Source**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Set Permissions** (if deployment fails)
   ```
   https://github.com/hanzoai/store/settings/actions
   ```

### Option 2: CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Enable Pages via API (requires repo admin access)
gh api repos/hanzoai/store/pages \
  -X POST \
  -f source[branch]=main \
  -f source[path]=/
```

## 🌐 Your Store URL

Once enabled, your store will be available at:

```
https://hanzoai.github.io/store/
```

## 🔗 Custom Domain (Optional)

To use `store.hanzo.ai`:

1. **Add DNS CNAME Record**
   ```
   Type:  CNAME
   Name:  store
   Value: hanzoai.github.io
   ```

2. **Configure in GitHub**
   - Go to: https://github.com/hanzoai/store/settings/pages
   - Under "Custom domain", enter: `store.hanzo.ai`
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS"
   - Click "Save"

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation** (5-30 minutes)
